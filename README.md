# OaklandBuildHistory

This project explores the year houses were built in a few
neighborhoods of Oakland, focusing on the late 19th and early 20th
Century.

An explanation of the project is available in 'Oakland
development.ipynb', which describes all of the relevant scripts here.

Also included are several map images.  The raw data set is referenced
in the jupyter notebook mentioned above, and the processed data set is
'Oakland_parcels_queried.zip'.
